[GODI](http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/index.html) is a grotesquely overbuilt
nightmare, [OASIS](http://oasis.forge.ocamlcore.org/) and
[OASIS-DB](http://oasis.forge.ocamlcore.org/oasis-db.html) are hit or miss. I
just want to have some managed bits of (J)OCaml available to me. I'm only a
part-time OCaml developer, so dependencies may go stale or break. Also, the
build process for a lot of these is weirdly fragile, so it may take some
cajolery with `brew install --debug` to get everything to install properly.

Bugs and additional formulae welcome.
